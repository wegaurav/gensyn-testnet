## 🌐 Rent GPU
> [!Note]
> **Renting GPU is not necessarily needed, you can still run this node on VPS or on WSL, but you may face OOM error plus you may have less winning rate, that is why my recommendation is renting a GPU if you can, otherwise you can proceed with VPS or WSL.**
- Visit : [Quick Pod Website](https://console.quickpod.io?affiliate=64e0d2b2-59ee-4989-a05f-f4c3b6dbb2e4)
- Sign Up using email address
- Go to your email and verify your Quick Pod account
- Click on `Add` button in the corner to deposit fund
- You can deposit using crypto currency (from metamask) or using Credit card
- Now go to `template` section and then select `Ubuntu 22.04 jammy` in the below
- Now click on `Select GPU` and search `RTX 4090` and choose it
- Now choose a GPU and click on `Create POD` button
- Your GPU server will be deployed soon
- You can simply click on `Connect` button and then choose `Connect to Web Terminal`
- But if you are using different gpu provider then you should use `Connect via SSH` method mentioned below

## 🛜 Connect via SSH (Only for GPU)
> [!Note]
> **This step is only required if you running this node on GPU, if you want to use VPS or WSL, then skip this step and login to your VPS server using username and password which u received from the VPS provider and then move to [installation](https://github.com/zunxbt/gensyn-testnet?tab=readme-ov-file#-installation) section**
- First open a terminal (this could be either WSL / Codespace / Command Prompt)
- Use this below command to generate SSH-Key
```
ssh-keygen
```
- It will ask 3 questions like this :
```
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/codespace/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again: 
```
- You need to press `Enter` 3 times
- After that you will get a message like this on your terminal
```
Your public key has been saved in /home/codespace/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
- `/home/codespace/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` is the path of this public key in my case, in your case it might be different

- You should use this command to see those ssh key :
    - If you are using Linux/macOS (WSL) : `cat path/of/that/publickey` , in my case, it would be : `cat /home/codespace/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
    - If you are using Command Prompt : `type path\of\that\publickey`, in my case, it would be : `type \home\codespace\.ssh\id_rsa.pub`
    - If you are using PowerShell : `Get-Content path\of\that\publickey`, in my case, it would be : `Get-Content \home\codespace\.ssh\id_rsa.pub`
- Now copy this public key and go to hosting provider from where you bought GPU
- After visiting the web hosting provider website, navigate to settings and there paste and save your ssh key
- Now, copy the command you received after renting the GPU instance and paste it into the terminal where you generated the public key.
- In my case, the command looks like this:
```
ssh -p 69 root@69.69.69.69
```
- Now paste this command on this terminal to access your GPU server

## 📥 Installation

1. **Install `sudo`**
```bash
apt update && apt install -y sudo
```
2. **Install other dependencies**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3 python3-venv python3-pip curl wget screen git lsof nano unzip iproute2
```
3. **Install Node.js and npm**  
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zunxbt/installation/main/node.sh | bash
```
4. **Create a `screen` session**
```bash
screen -S gensyn
```
5. **Run the swarm**
```bash
cd $HOME && rm -rf gensyn-testnet && git clone https://github.com/zunxbt/gensyn-testnet.git && chmod +x gensyn-testnet/gensyn.sh && ./gensyn-testnet/gensyn.sh
```
- It will ask some questions, you should send response properly
- ```Would you like to push models you train in the RL swarm to the Hugging Face Hub? [y/N]``` : Write `N`
- When you will see interface like this, you can detach from this screen session

![Screenshot 2025-04-01 061641](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5ed9645-16a2-4911-8a73-97e21fdde274)

7. **Detach from `screen session`**
- Use `Ctrl + A` and then press `D` to detach from this screen session.

 ## 🔄️ Back up `swarm.pem`
After running the Gensyn node, it is essential to back up the swarm.pem file from your remote server (GPU or VPS) to your local PC. If you lose this file, your contribution will also be lost. I will mention 2 method , 1 is simpler but not that much secure and another one is secure but a lil bit complex for the beginners

### Method 1 (Very Simple)
- First make sure that you are in `rl-swarm` folder and then run this command
```
[ -f backup.sh ] && rm backup.sh; curl -sSL -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zunxbt/gensyn-testnet/main/backup.sh && chmod +x backup.sh && ./backup.sh
```
- It will show something like this in your terminal
 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/489b02a8-40e1-4c91-b29b-9d9c30604e8c)

1️⃣ **VPS/GPU/WSL to PC**
- If you want to backup `swarm.pem`(Must), `userData.json` (Optional), `userApiKey.json` (Optional) from VPS/GPU/WSL to your PC then simply **visit the URL** (don't use the commands mentioned below) and press `Ctrl + S` to save these files.

2️⃣ **One VPS/GPU/WSL to another VPS/GPU/WSL**
- If you want to backup `swarm.pem`(Must), `userData.json` (Optional), `userApiKey.json` (Optional) from One VPS/GPU/WSL to another VPS/GPU/WSL then simply use the **commands** on another VPS/GPU/WSL where you want to use these files.

### Method 2 (Manual)
If you face any issue with this automated back up process then it is recommended to use manual guide : [Click Here](https://github.com/zunxbt/gensyn-testnet/blob/main/BACKUP.md)

## 🟢 Node Status

### 1. Check Logs
- To check whether your node is running or not, you can check logs
- To check logs you need to re-attach with screen session, so use the below command
```
screen -r gensyn
```
- If you see everything running then it's fine
- Now detach from this screen session, Use `Ctrl + A` and then press `D` to detach from this screen session.
- Everytime you reattach, every time you should detach

### 2. Check Wins
- Visit : https://gensyn-node.vercel.app/
- Enter Peer-ID that you often see this in your logs
- The more win, the better

> [!Note]
> If you see `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` in `Connected EOA Address` section, that means your contribution is not being recorded, so you should run the node from beginning with fresh new email (means u need to delete existing `swarm.pem` file

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### 🔴 Daemon failed to start in 15.0 seconds
- If you are facing this issue then follow this step by step guide
- First use tihs command
```
nano $(python3 -c "import hivemind.p2p.p2p_daemon as m; print(m.__file__)")
```
- Then scroll down and look for this line `startup_timeout: float = 15,` , here u need to modify this 15 with 120, and after modifying it will look like this : `startup_timeout: float = 120,`
- Save this changes, first use `Ctrl` + `X` and then press `Y` and then press `Enter`
- Now use this command again to run `rl-swarm`
```bash
./run_rl_swarm.sh
```
